#### Abstract
This is an evaluation of the latest human trafficking reports per province, against the major contributors of crime in South Africa.

Alongside my vocational experience with Statistics South Africa, I was able to carry out the following investigation using South African Crime Statistics on Kaggle, R Studio, and Tableau.

The data was prepared:

- Zip folder containing dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harutyunagababyan/crime-stats-of-south-africa-2011-2023
- Latest crime statistics

The data is indeed limited, in that it only spans the eleven-year period. The data had to remain encrypted and entirely anonymous, as to ensure safety for the persons who reported the crimes herein contained.

The data presented as a CSV is accessible and credible: R Studio was used for the purpose of tabulating it.

The data is provided on the South African crime statistics between the year 2011 and 2023. The parameters, by criterion, will be tabulated in this report, based on the nature and demographics of the crime.

The data was processed as follows, so as to yield the desired visuals and information.

I) The data is tabulated annually against the category of the criminal offense (R-Studio)

In R Studio, we observe the categorically South African crimes

```
library(readr)

crime_incidents_by_category <- read_csv("Downloads/crime_incidents_by_category.csv")
View(crime_incidents_by_category) 
```

II) The dataset is visualised over the entire span of the 2011–2023 term (**Tableau**)

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
